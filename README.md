### Process.


### Wins & Challenges.
#### Wins 💪🏻
- We have a function app that meets all requirements.
- Our ability to quickly adapt to an agile working style when our initial plan for development had to change.

#### Challenges 😮‍💨
- Early in the project a member of our team experienced severe computer issues and was unable to contribute to our codebase for a large part of the week. However as a team we quickly pivoted and adapted our working style to accommodate for this.
- Time constraints were tough, especially being a person down.

### Known Bugs.
Any currently known bugs can been seen or reported [here](https://github.com/Poligera/1st-portfolio-project/issues)

### Potential Future Features.
When we started the development process we established a set of 'nice to haves' which would be implemented if time allowed. This list can be found on our project board [here](https://github.com/Poligera/1st-portfolio-project/projects/1)
